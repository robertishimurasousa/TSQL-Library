-- TSQL Library: SP Logical Writes
-- Author: Glenn Berry. Adaptation: split and categorized by TSQL Library.
-- Context: user database to inspect; select it in the client before execution
-- Target platform: Azure SQL Managed Instance (upstream suite; not execution-tested).
-- Mode: metadata reads
-- Permissions: Permissions depend on the referenced objects and platform; see docs/glenn-berry/README.md. Minimum grants have not been execution-tested.
-- Notes: Original explanatory comments are retained; dated recommendations are historical. Results may disclose environment details, SQL text, plans or log contents; review before sharing.

-- This helps you find the most expensive cached stored procedures from a write I/O perspective
-- You should look at this if you see signs of I/O pressure or of memory pressure
