-- Page Life Expectancy (PLE) value for each NUMA node in current instance  (Query 36) (PLE by NUMA Node)
SELECT @@SERVERNAME AS [Server Name], RTRIM([object_name]) AS [Object Name], instance_name, cntr_value AS [Page Life Expectancy]
FROM sys.dm_os_performance_counters WITH (NOLOCK)

-- PLE is a good measurement of memory pressure.
-- Higher PLE is better. Watch the trend over time, not the absolute value.
-- This will only return one row for non-NUMA systems.

-- Page Life Expectancy isn’t what you think…
