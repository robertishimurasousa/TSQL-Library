-- MEMORYCLERK_SQLBUFFERPOOL was new for SQL Server 2012. It should be your highest consumer of memory

-- CACHESTORE_SQLCP  SQL Plans
-- These are cached SQL statements or batches that aren't in stored procedures, functions and triggers
-- Watch out for high values for CACHESTORE_SQLCP
-- Enabling 'optimize for ad hoc workloads' at the instance level can help reduce this
-- Running DBCC FREESYSTEMCACHE ('SQL Plans') periodically may be required to better control this

-- CACHESTORE_OBJCP  Object Plans
-- These are compiled plans for stored procedures, functions and triggers
