-- Gives you some good basic hardware information about your database server
-- Note: virtual_machine_type_desc of HYPERVISOR does not automatically mean you are running SQL Server inside of a VM
-- It merely indicates that you have a hypervisor running on your host

-- sys.dm_os_sys_info (Transact-SQL)
-- https://bit.ly/2pczOYs

-- Soft NUMA configuration was a new column for SQL Server 2016
-- OFF = Soft-NUMA feature is OFF
-- ON = SQL Server automatically determines the NUMA node sizes for Soft-NUMA
-- MANUAL = Manually configured soft-NUMA

-- Configure SQL Server to Use Soft-NUMA (SQL Server)
