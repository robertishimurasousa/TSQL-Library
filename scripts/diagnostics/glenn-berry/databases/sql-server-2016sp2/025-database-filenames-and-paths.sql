-- Things to look at:
-- Are data files and log files on different drives?
-- Is everything on the C: drive?
-- Is tempdb on dedicated drives?
-- Is there only one tempdb data file?
-- Are all of the tempdb data files the same size?
-- Are there multiple data files for user databases?
-- Is percent growth enabled for any files (which is bad)?
